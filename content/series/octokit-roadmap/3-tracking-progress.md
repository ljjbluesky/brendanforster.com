description: "Before going further, I took a step back to think about goals to
aim for and how to track progress towards these goals? A potentially silly idea
that leverages GitHub Actions as well as GitHub Pages to do this in an
automated fashion fell out of this work, which was a fun side quest"

The next step on this journey is to set some goals and identify how we can
measure them. Questions I'd like to answer:

 - how much of the documented API surface is implemented in the client?
 - how much of the client API is generated, versus hand-coded?
 - how much undocumented API surface have we accrued over time?

Stretch goals:

 - can I generate a simple site with visuals from this data?
 - can I generate this in a scripted fashion?
