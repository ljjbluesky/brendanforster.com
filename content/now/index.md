title: What I'm Doing Now
---

If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again I'll update this.

## Where?

I'm currently up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Planning to be back in Australia in December but not much else planned.

## Upcoming Conferences

None planned.

## Side Projects

Work's been busy. I'll revisit this later.

## What about XYZ?

I'm trying to narrow the amount of things I have going on at once to get a
better work-life balance. I don't mind making myself available to bounce ideas
around if time permits, but I'd have to take things off my plate before
considering new work.

## I want to get in touch!

My contact details are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shiftkey/).

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), if that's your scene.
