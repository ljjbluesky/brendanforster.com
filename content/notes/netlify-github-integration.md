### Automate deployments of pull requests to Netlify

Netlify is a great product for deploying websites like ours, and their GitHub
integration means that each PR that's opened against the project gets a public
URL that you can view and verify the changes with.

This has been a huge timesaver for reviewers because they don't need to build
and verify the changes locally - they can just browse to the Preview Deploy URL
instead.
